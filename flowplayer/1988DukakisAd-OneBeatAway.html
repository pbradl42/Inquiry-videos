		   <span class="description">Ad produced by Dukasis in the 1988 campaign 'criticizing' Bush for choosing Quayle as his running mate.  There ad shows a photo of the oval office while a heartbeat plays in the background.  The ad ends by reminding us that 1 in 5 VPs have had to step up to President, and &quot;Hopefully, we'll never know how big a mistake&quot; choosing Quayle was.
