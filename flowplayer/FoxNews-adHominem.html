        <span class="description">Random clip from Fox news - in this one, the host reads an email lambasting Maureen Dowd, even calling her a 'viper'.  The email makes no points, and one wonders why it was aired, other than media bias.  A quick web search, white pages search and public information search revealed no trace of the author, making one wonder if this wasn't written by Fox news itself.</span>
