        <span class="description">The climatic clip from the classic 1932 movie 'Freaks.' Cleopatra, the beautiful trapeze artist has seduced and married Hans, the 'circus midget' to get his money; although she is actively flirting with Hercules, the body builder.  At their wedding banquet, the circus freaks start pounding on the table and chanting 'We accept her. One of Us. We accept her. One of Us. Gooble-Gobble. One of Us.

If you haven't seen the movie, I won't spoil the ending. Let's just say that Cleopatra and Hercules must pay for their crimes...</span>
