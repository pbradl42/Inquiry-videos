        <span class="description">This scene is at the beginning of the third part of 2001.  In it, HAL, the ship's computer, is being interviewed by a television reporter from the US.  When questioned about his abilities, HAL boasts &quot;Let me put it this way, Mr. Kramer.  No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information.  We are, by any practical definitions of the words, foolproof and incapable of error.&quot;</span>
