		   <span class="description">The Bush campaign ran a series of ads using the phrase 'John Kerry and the Liberals in Congress' in the last few weeks before the 2004 election.  This is a compliation of clips from those ads. Notice how the phrase is introduced <em>as if</em> it was overheard on the radio, and then adopted by the campaign.</span>
