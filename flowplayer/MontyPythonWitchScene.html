        <span class="description">In perhaps the most famous scene from Monty Python's most famous movie, a mob is lead through the basic reasoning of verificationism: first, consider the conditions of knowledge (&quot;How do you know that she is a witch&quot;), then produce a theory (&quot;Witches burn&quot;), deduce a prediction (&quot;If she will burn, she is made of wood, therefore she'll float.  And if she floats, then she's lighter than a duck.&quot;) Check to see if the prediction is confirmed, and burn away!</span>
