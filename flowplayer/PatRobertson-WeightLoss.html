		   <span class="description">There is a great deal to talk about in this one. Notice, first of all, how the commericials meld seemlessly into the content of the program. Second, notice the authority with which Robertson discusses biochemistry. Forget what you might know about this for a moment - does he appear authoritative?  Does he give you any actual data, peer reviewed studies, explanations that are mechanistically plausible? Why is a theologian dabbling in biochemistry anyway?</span>
