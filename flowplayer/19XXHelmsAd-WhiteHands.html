		   <span class="description">Famous Jessie Helm's advert showing white hands crumpling up a rejection letter, while the voice over laments that it was all because some <em>minority</em> got preferential treatment. Note that his opponent in this election was African-American. Not only an appeal to fear, but one that, like Reagan's use of Philadelphia, MS, was meant to galvanize the racist underbelly of white North Carolina. Insulting only until one realizes that Helms won that election.
