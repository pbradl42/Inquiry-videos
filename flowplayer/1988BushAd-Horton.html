		   <span class="description">The ad that may have won the 1988 election for Bush the first.  The ad claims that under Dukasis, Willie Horton was given a weekend pass from pris
on, which he used to engage in the activities of &quot;Kidnapping..  Stabbing... Raping&quot;.  If we charitably allow it as an argument, it is a clear appeal to fear: vote for Bush or else a bunch of black men will be out stabbin' and rapin'!
