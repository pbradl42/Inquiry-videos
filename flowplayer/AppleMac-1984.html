        <span class="description">Probably the most famous advertisment of all time: the first 30-second Mac advert shown during the Super Bowl in 1984.  Die hard fans of the ad still claim that Apple only paid once to show it, and it was shown again and again on local TV channels, award shows and the like. In reality, Apple paid to show it at least twice - once on the Super Bowl, and once at something like 3 in the morning in Iowa, in order to qualify for the annual advertising awards.
